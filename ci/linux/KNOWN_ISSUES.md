# Known issues (Linux CI)

## Ubuntu 22.04 (experimental)

- Ubuntu is **not** an officially supported OpenRV build target.
- This job is best-effort and uses `continue-on-error: true` in CI; it does **not** block releases.
- Document any recurring failures here (e.g. missing libs, Qt path differences).
